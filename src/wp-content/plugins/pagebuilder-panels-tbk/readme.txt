Build responsive page layouts using the widgets you know and love using this simple drag and drop page builder.

== Description ==

[vimeo http://vimeo.com/59561067]

Over the years, WordPress has evolved into a fully functional CMS. SiteOrigin Page Builder completes the transition by giving you a way to create responsive column layouts using the widgets you know and love.

= Use Your Widgets =

You know widgets. They're the things you add to your sidebars. SiteOrigin Page Builder makes all your widgets infinitely more useful by turning them into the building blocks of your pages.

We've included a few useful widgets, but it works with any that your themes or plugins add.

= Works with Most Themes =

The Page Builder works with most well made themes. The only requirement is that your theme supports pages. And if your theme is responsive, change a few settings and boom, your layouts will work with your theme and collapse into a single column on mobile devices.

There are loads free and premium themes that work with the Page Builder, we have our own collection of [free themes](http://siteorigin.com/) if you'd like to use one of ours.

= Bundled Widgets =

To get you started, we've include a few widgets.

* Gallery widget for inserting image galleries.
* Image widget for inserting standard images.
* Self hosted video widget for embedding your own videos.
* Post Loop to display a list of posts. This requires that your theme supports it.
